4. Portfolio Overview
    * Currently, our application only allows users to have one portfolio at a time.
    * Users can manually add transactions into their portfolio to keep track of their profit/loss over the time.
    * For each transaction, the user has to only specify three basic things: What is the coin they are trading? What is the type of transaction i.e. buying or selling? What is the exact amount?
    * Unicoin would use the data from users’ transactions to calculate the profit/loss of their portfolio, giving insights for amateur investors before actually diving into the cryptocurrency market using real money.
